## 📚 Recommended Resources

* **W3Schools** → For Python & C++ syntax refreshers, quick lookups, and basic examples.
  🔗 [https://www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com)
* **LeetCode / Codeforces / GeeksforGeeks** → For C++ DSA practice.
* **Kaggle / DataWars** → For Data Analysis & ML practice.
* **GitHub** → Maintain daily commits for accountability.

## 🗓️ Phase 1 (Days 1–10): Python Foundations

**Goal:** Build strong programming fundamentals.

**Focus Areas:**

* Variables, loops, conditionals, and functions
* Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
* File handling and comprehensions
* Basic OOP (classes, objects)

**Parallel C++ DSA:**

* Syntax, loops, functions, arrays
* Pointers and references

**Daily Routine Example:**

* 🐍 2 hours Python (practice small scripts)
* ⚙️ 1 hour C++ problem-solving (simple loops/arrays)

**Milestone:**
✅ Confident with basic syntax, can write simple algorithms in both Python and C++.

---

## 🧮 Phase 2 (Days 11–20): NumPy & Core DSA

**Goal:** Learn numerical computing and essential data structures.

**Python (NumPy):**

* Array creation: `np.array`, `np.zeros`, `np.ones`, `np.arange`
* Array attributes: `.shape`, `.size`, `.dtype`
* Slicing, reshaping, broadcasting
* Basic linear algebra (`np.dot`, `np.linalg.inv`)

**C++ DSA:**

* Structures, classes, vectors, strings
* Sorting algorithms and searching

**Resources:**

* W3Schools → NumPy & C++ STL basics
* Practice daily problems on LeetCode (Array/Vector category)

**Milestone:**
✅ Efficient with NumPy and comfortable manipulating arrays.
✅ Able to implement search/sort algorithms manually.

---

## 🧱 Phase 3 (Days 21–30): Pandas + Intermediate DSA

**Goal:** Learn how to clean, analyze, and summarize tabular data.

**Python (Pandas):**

* DataFrames and Series basics
* Import/export CSVs
* Filtering, sorting, grouping, merging
* Handling missing values
* Descriptive stats and `.corr()`

**C++ DSA:**

* Linked lists, stacks, and queues
* Object-oriented patterns and STL containers (`map`, `set`)

**Practice:**

* Analyze sample CSV datasets from Kaggle or DataWars.
* Solve 1–2 LeetCode DSA problems daily.

**Milestone:**
✅ Can perform full EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).
✅ Understand core data structures thoroughly.

---

## 📊 Phase 4 (Days 31–45): DataWars + Advanced DSA

**Goal:** Apply analysis & visualization to real datasets and learn advanced logic in C++.

**Python / ML:**

* Work on 2–3 DataWars challenges.
* Focus on cleaning, visualizing, and documenting findings.
* Learn scikit-learn basics (`train_test_split`, `fit`, `predict`).

**C++ DSA:**

* Trees, recursion, graphs
* STL: priority_queue, unordered_map
* Recursion & dynamic programming basics

**Daily Routine:**

* 🐍 2.5 hrs on DataWars or notebook projects
* ⚙️ 1.5 hrs on C++ problem sets

**Milestone:**
✅ Submitted first DataWars project.
✅ Implemented recursive and tree-based solutions in C++.

---

## 🤖 Phase 5 (Days 46–60): Kaggle & Advanced ML Integration

**Goal:** Transition to full ML workflows.

**Python / ML:**

* Beginner Kaggle competitions (Titanic, House Prices)
* Feature engineering and evaluation metrics
* Model improvement techniques
* Visualization & documentation for GitHub portfolio

**C++ DSA:**

* Master dynamic programming
* Participate in one Codeforces or LeetCode contest weekly

**Milestone:**
✅ Completed a Kaggle beginner competition.
✅ Achieved consistent problem-solving rhythm in C++ contests.

## 🧾 Summary (Flexible Path Version)

For learners who prefer flexibility over strict timelines:

| Stage | Focus                     | Key Tools        | Outcome                                      |
| ----- | ------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| 1️⃣   | **Programming basics**    | Python, C++      | Foundational understanding of syntax & logic |
| 2️⃣   | **Numerical computing**   | NumPy            | Efficient data manipulation                  |
| 3️⃣   | **Data analysis**         | Pandas           | Confident with data cleaning and EDA         |
| 4️⃣   | **Problem-solving**       | C++ STL, DSA     | Strong algorithmic reasoning                 |
